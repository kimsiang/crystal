=== Description ===

This experiment aims to check whether G4 correctly uses a given absorption length.

Photons: 2.952 eV

=== Theoretical outcome ===

The mean absorbtion length lambda should be 184.5 mm

=== Actual outcome ===

The experiment is succesfull, with a measured lambda of about 185 mm
