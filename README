=== Description ===

This test should check whether G4 respects Fresnel's law of reflection.

- Setup:
Crystal 1800 mm long, with the source at 100 mm distant from one end, shooting towards it.
The photons will be arriving from a perpendicular direction.

Firing 100000 (10^5) photons, 2.952 eV, nâ‰ƒ2.2 and lambda=185.4mm.

=== Theoretical outcome ===

About 58500 (58.5%) of the photons should reach the face of the crystal without being absorbed,
at which point about 8000 (8% of the original 10^5) should be reflected back, and the rest would
continue their journey towards infinite (and beyond).

=== Actual outcome ===

The data shows agreement. In particular:

* MomentumIn: (the number of photons reaching the crystal's face) is about 58300

* MomentumOut (the number of photons that quit the sensor's face) and NumOfPhotonsThatQuitTheCrystal
agree that about 50100 photons leave the crystal

* BulkAbsorbtionTime correctly shows that 49905 photons are absorbed within the crystal (at different times)
