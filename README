When doing a new experiment/test/benchmark:

1) Create a branch for your setup
2) Make sure you commit in the branch only the code relevant to your
   experiment. General fixes belong to master.
3) Edit this file to contain a brief description of what you are doing,
   expected (theoretical) results and outcome of your tests.
